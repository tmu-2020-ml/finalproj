    <p>
      Gastric cancer (GC) has the 5th incidence rate among cancers and is the
      3rd leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
    </p>
    <img src="images/p1_1.png" alt="" />
    <p>Eastern Asia has the highest incidence rate of GC around the world.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a collaboration between the National
        Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Human Genome Research Institute
        (NHGRI), has generated comprehensive, multi-dimensional maps of the key
        genomic changes in 33 types of cancer. The TCGA dataset, describing
        tumor tissue and matched normal tissues from more than 11,000 patients,
        is publically available and has been used widely by the research
        community. The data have contributed to more than a thousand studies of
        cancer by independent researchers and to the TCGA research network
        publications.

        TCGA stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) gene expression by RNAseq (polyA+
        IlluminaHiSeq BC).
      </p>
      <p>
        The gene expression profile was measured experimentally using the
        Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA Sequencing platform by the British Columbia
        Cancer Agency TCGA genome characterization center. Level 3 data was
        downloaded from TCGA data coordination center. This dataset shows the
        gene-level transcription estimates, as in RPKM values (Reads Per
        Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads). Genes are mapped onto
        the human genome coordinates using UCSC Xena HUGO probeMap (see ID/Gene
        mapping link below for details).

        ... We evidenced a gene expression signature associated to muscle
        contraction-related genes in specimens obtained from OSCC patients with
        lymph node involvement. This gene signature suggests the presence of
        myofibroblasts in tumor stoma of patients with lymph node involvement
        and emphasizes the decisive role played by myofibroblasts probably
        through their secretome in determining OSCC invasiveness.
